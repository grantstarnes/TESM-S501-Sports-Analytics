#SPORT CUSTOMER RETENTION MODEL: 
#In this two-week assignment, we delve into the dynamic world of sport customer retention,focusing on a case study involving an NFL team. 
#Retaining loyal and engaged fans is paramount for the long-term success and sustainability of any sports franchise. 
#But this is not always easy as the data often arrives in a challenging format

#This data set was dumped from an NFL team’s ticketing system. 
#The primary goal of the investigation is to understand customer retention, specifically, the factors that predict whether or not a customer (season ticket holders in this case) will return. 
#The team has experienced some success in recent years with achieving two invitations to the playoffs in 2018 and 2019. 
#The team achieved the following win percentages in each season: 2018 (.688), 2019 (.625), 2020 (.250), 2021 (.235), 2022 (.206), 2023 (.429). 
#The data set excludes 2020 given the pandemic year. 

#We will work in 5 descriptive phases for day 1: 
#1) Consider the variable definitions and start to brainstorm predictive variables and our retention or outcome variable. 
#2) Preliminary data cleaning and summarizing 
#3) Add missing data (athletic success) 
#4) Descriptive insights about season ticket purchases
#5) Begin the process of considering what our final baseline model will look like for phase 2.

Retention_Dataset = read_excel("/Users/grantstarnes/Desktop/Retention_Dataset.xlsx")
#Key commands
#apply - applying functions without a loop 
#%>% - pass the output of one function directly into the next,

#First, think about the variables and their definitions.
  #Which variables do you think might be predictive? 
  #Which column represents the retention/outcome variable? 

#Second, let's consider some preliminary data cleaning and summarizing. 

# Count the number of duplicate rows
num_duplicates <- sum(duplicated(Retention_Dataset))
# Print the result
print(num_duplicates)
# Finding duplicate rows
duplicate_rows <- Retention_Dataset[duplicated(Retention_Dataset), ]
# Display duplicate rows
print(duplicate_rows) 
# Remove only one occurrence of each duplicate row, keeping the first occurrence
Retention_unique <- Retention_Dataset[!duplicated(Retention_Dataset), ]
# Display the data frame with only one instance of each row
View(Retention_unique)

summary(Retention_unique)
#What does the summary help us understand about each variable? 
#Specifically consider row_name, resale variables and team success measures 

# Convert all character columns to factors
Retention_factor <- Retention_unique
Retention_factor[] <- lapply(Retention_unique, function(x) if (is.character(x)) as.factor(x) else x)
# What other variables might be best considered as factors? 

# Check the structure to confirm conversion
str(Retention_factor)

#Summarize the variables with factor levels 
factor_summary <- sapply(Retention_factor[sapply(Retention_factor, is.factor)], summary)

# Display the summary
factor_summary
#What does the summary help us understand about the variables with factor levels? 

#Third, let's take a moment to add in the athletic success measures to the data set. 
#Customer data sets, however, Work as a group to find the best/most efficient way to do this. 


#Fourth, let's think about some initial season ticket holder customer insights. 
#What do we know about season ticket holder transaction patterns?
