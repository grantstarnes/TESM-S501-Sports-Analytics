# TESM-S501: Sports Analytics - Fall 2025 Overview
This Sports Analytics repository holds the technical content covered over the course of the Fall 2025 semester. Here, you will find lab work, challenges, and project submissions that have sharpened my sport analytics specific skills and helped me excel in the field overall.

## About Me
- I am an applied data science student specializing in sports analytics at IU Indianapolis, where I recently completed my first semester in the program. My work focuses on using statistical modeling, data visualization, and programming to extract insights from sports data and support data-driven decision making. I regularly document and share my projects using GitHub, highlighting hands-on coursework and applied analytics work.

## Relevant Projects
### Final Project Phase I
- This first step in the final project process was an introduction to working with different built-in Python libraries, such as pandas and numpy, setting necessary parameters for the specific data being analyzed, and loading the data successfully. For this project step, I looked at the first Indianapolis Colts game of the 2025 season vs. the Miami Dolphins. I then analyzed different areas of the game, for example, scoring by quarter, Colts' offensive play mix, Colts receivers total EPA vs. number of targets, and the Colts' rolling pass rate.


### Final Project Phase II
- For the second phase of the final project process, we began working with real data from the Big Data Bowl Competition presented on Kaggle, where the challenge for this year was metrics while the ball is in the air. For my ideas in the project step, I first looked at how quickly defenders reacted while the ball was in the air, and was able to segment my analysis by man and zone coverage, as well as pass outcome (complete, incomplete, or interception). For my second idea, I looked at how coverage success affects game outcomes. More specifically, I analyzed average separation by coverage type (Man vs. Zone Coverage), as well as average separation by pass result (complete, incomplete, or interception).
